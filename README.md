# lane-stadium-analysis
This is a project for my Foundations of Engineering class at Virginia Tech. The assignment was to choose a problem and then collect data related to the problem that could be analyzed. My group chose the problem of overcrowding at Lane Stadium (Virginia Tech's football stadium). For our data collection, we surveyed a sample of students to see how many of them were able to get a student section seat and how many of them broke into a game over the span of 4 games. We then used the data to create a model that would use line of best fits to determine if overcrowding was a problem at Lane Stadium. Based on the data that we collected, the model suggested that overcrowding was a problem at Lane Stadium.
